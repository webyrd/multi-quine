# multi-quine
Generation of simple multi-language quines using relational interpreters for two Scheme-like languages.

Language 1 supports 'cons' but not 'list', while language 2 supports 'list' but not 'cons'.

See the test "multi-lang-quines-langs-1-and-2-non-cheeky" for multi-language quine inference.

TODO
* What languages/features would be more interesting?  
* How many different languages could we handle?
